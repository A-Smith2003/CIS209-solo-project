            <p class="navy-p-text"><strong>Author:</strong> Matt Haig</p>
            <p class="navy-p-text">
              Nora Seed feels overwhelmed by regret and the belief that she has
              let everyone down, prompting her to attempt to end her life. She
              finds herself in a magical library managed by her childhood
              librarian, Mrs. Elm. Each book on the shelves allows her to
              experience a life she could have lived if she had made different
              choices—such as becoming a glaciologist, an Olympian, or staying
              in a different relationship. The book is a fast-paced,,
              philosophical exploration of what makes life worth living.

              <strong>Title:</strong> The Thursday Murder Club
            </p>
            <p class="navy-p-text"><strong>Author:</strong> Richard Osman</p>
            <p class="navy-p-text">
              Set in the peaceful Cooper's Chase retirement village, the club
              meets weekly in the Jigsaw Room to discuss unsolved mysteries.
              However, the group—a former spy, a nurse, a psychiatrist, and a
              union activist—soon find a real murder on their doorstep. They use
              their combined skills and unassuming, elderly status to
              investigate, much to the dismay of local detectives. The story
              combines suspense with humor, charm, and poignant reflections on
              aging and friendship. The book is the first in a best-selling
              series by British television presenter Richard Osman.
